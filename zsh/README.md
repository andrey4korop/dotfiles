# Zsh

This directory contains configuration files for the Zsh (Z shell) and the Powerlevel10k theme.

## Files

*   `.zshrc`: The main configuration file for Zsh. It is sourced when you start an interactive shell. This file sets up shell options, aliases, functions, environment variables, and loads the prompt theme.
*   `.p10k.zsh`: The configuration file for the [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) prompt theme. It defines the appearance of the command prompt, including icons, colors, and the information that is displayed (e.g., git status, path, etc.). This file is typically sourced from `.zshrc`.
*   `.config/bat/config`: Configuration for the `bat` command, a `cat` clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration. This file can be used to set the theme and other `bat` options.
